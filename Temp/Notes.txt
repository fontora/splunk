Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit

MLTK app version 5.1.0 is now included in the ES installer. The previously generated models from MLTK 5.0 are compatible as-is. The previously generated models MLTK 4.x are not compatible and have to be regenerated. See Machine Learning Toolkit Overview in Splunk Enterprise Security for general information about models in MLTK 5.1.0.
