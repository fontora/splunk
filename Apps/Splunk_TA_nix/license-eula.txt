Customer agrees to assume full responsibility for the performance and distribution of Customer Extensions.

    2.2 Open Source Software. Certain Software may contain Open Source Software identified in the end user documentation.

3. SERVICE PROVIDERS. Customer may permit its Service Providers to use the Software solely on Customer"s behalf in connection with providing services to Customer, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

These terms are incorporated by reference and made a part of this Agreement. 
8. SOFTWARE VERIFICATION AND AUDIT. At Splunk"s request, Customer will furnish Splunk with a certification signed by Customer"s authorized representative verifying that the Software is being used in accordance with this Agreement and the applicable Order. If the Order includes an offering that requires usage reporting, Customer agrees to provide this reporting pursuant to the requirements identified by Splunk. Upon at least 10 business days" prior written notice to Customer, and not more than once in a 12-month period, unless a material violation occurred in this period, Splunk may audit Customer"s (and its Service Providers") use of the Software to ensure compliance with this Agreement and the applicable Order. Any audit will be conducted during regular business hours at Customer"s (and/or its Service Providers") facilities, will not unreasonably interfere with Customer"s (or its Service Providers") business and will comply with Customer"s (or its Service Providers") reasonable security procedures. Customer will (and will ensure that its Service Providers) provide Splunk with reasonable access to all relevant records and facilities reasonably necessary to conduct the audit. If an audit reveals that Customer (and/or any Service Provider) has exceeded the Licensed Capacity or the scope of Customer"s license grant during the period audited, then Splunk will invoice Customer, and Customer will promptly pay Splunk, any underpaid Fees based on Splunk"s price list in effect at the time the audit is completed. If the excess usage exceeds 10% of the Licensed Capacity, Customer will also pay Splunk"s reasonable costs of conducting the audit. This section 8 will survive expiration or termination of this Agreement for a period of 1 year. 
9. WARRANTY. Splunk warrants that for a period of 30 days from the Delivery of Purchased Software, the Purchased Software will substantially perform the material functions described in Splunk"s user documentation, when used in accordance with the user documentation. The sole liability of Splunk (and its Affiliates and suppliers/licensors), and Customer"s exclusive remedy, for any failure of the Purchased Software to conform to this warranty, is for Splunk to do one of the following, at Splunk"s sole option and discretion: (a) modify, or provide an Enhancement for, the Purchased Software so that it conforms to the foregoing warranty, (b) replace Customer"s copy of the Purchased Software with a copy that conforms to the foregoing warranty, or (c) terminate the license with respect to the non-conforming Purchased Software and refund the License Fees paid by Customer for the non-conforming Purchased Software.

Customer, not Splunk, is solely responsible for the accuracy, quality, and security of Customer"s data and for maintaining a backup of all data and for ensuring the security and integrity of Customer"s (and its Service Provider"s) data, computers, networks, and systems (including protecting them against viruses and malware). 
12. INDEMNITY. Splunk will defend and indemnify Customer against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding brought against Customer by a third party alleging that Purchased Software infringes or misappropriates this third party"s Intellectual Property Rights ("Claim"). Splunk will pay all damages finally awarded against Customer by a court of competent jurisdiction as a result of the Claim, subject to the terms of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Splunk has no obligation to indemnify Customer with respect to: (a) use of the Purchased Software in a manner that is not permitted under this Agreement or that is inconsistent with Splunk"s applicable user documentation; (b) modifications to the Splunk Materials made by anyone other than Splunk; (c) the combination of Software with hardware or software not made by Splunk, or with third-party services, processes or materials where the infringement or misappropriation would not occur but for this combination; (d) Customer"s continued use of the Purchased Software or other allegedly infringing activity after receiving notice of the alleged infringement; or (e) any version of the Purchased Software that is no longer supported by Splunk ((a) through (e), collectively, "Excluded Matters").

If Splunk determines that neither is reasonably feasible, Splunk may terminate Customer"s applicable license and refund Customer a pro rata refund of the Fees previously paid by Customer. The obligations  in this section constitute Customer"s sole and exclusive remedy, and Splunk"s entire liability, with respect to any Claims. Customer will defend and indemnify Splunk against any claim brought against Splunk by a third party arising out of or relating to any Excluded Matter or any Customer Extension, and Customer will pay all damages finally awarded against Splunk by a court of competent jurisdiction as a result of this claim. Each party"s defense and indemnity obligations in this section 12 are conditioned upon the party seeking indemnification (x) providing prompt written notice to the other party of the applicable claim; (y) providing reasonable cooperation and assistance in the defense and negotiations; and (z) giving the indemnifying party sole control of the defense and settlement of the applicable claim, except that: (i) the indemnified party may participate in the defense with counsel of its choice at its own expense, and (ii) the indemnifying party will not agree to any settlement that imposes a material obligation on the indemnified party without the indemnified party"s prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

Recipient agrees that, due to the unique nature of the Confidential Information, the unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information will cause irreparable harm and significant injury to Discloser, the extent of which will be difficult to ascertain and for which there will be no adequate remedy at law. Accordingly, Recipient agrees that Discloser, in addition to any other available remedies, will have the right to an immediate injunction and other equitable relief enjoining any breach or threatened breach of this section 13, without the necessity of posting any bond or other security. Recipient will notify Discloser in writing immediately upon Recipient"s becoming aware of any breach or threatened breach.
